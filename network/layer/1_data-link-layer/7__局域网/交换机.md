## 2 `交换机` | `交换式集线器` | `以太网交换机` 
work in `data link layer` 
work in `全双工` 
have storage to cache `帧` 

#### 4   `帧交换表` | `地址表` 
it is self-study
receive `帧` and `转发` to goal address (cache + `转发` or `转发` directly)
When first use, it is empty
When very long not use one host , mapper data of this host will delete automatic

* When you send information, `交换表` will save you `MAC` 
1. host A send information to B 
2. `交换机` save mapper : `MAC A` and interface of host A
3. `交换机` search `交换表` to find goal `MAC` 
4. if not find, broadcast all other interface

##### 5    error of `转发` 
if two `交换机` compose loop by broadcast, `帧` may unceasing `转发` in this loop
method of resolve : `生成树协议STP`

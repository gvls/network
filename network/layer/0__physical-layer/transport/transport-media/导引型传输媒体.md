## 2 `导引型传输媒体` / `有线传输` 
`电磁波` be guided along with solid body



### 3  `双绞线` 
distance of transport is 1~10 km
If wire more thick , distance is more long
If distance so long , `signal` may weaken
If `signal` is weaken, we need `放大器` to magnify `signal` 
`5类线` have more `twist` degree than `3类限` 

#### 4   compose
`绞合twist`(decrease effect to other wire) two `copper wire` of `互相绝缘` 

#### 4   `数字信号` 
If `signal` is weaken, we need `中继器` to magnify `signal` 

#### 4   `模拟信号` 
If `signal` is weaken, we need `放大器` to magnify `signal` 

### 3  `屏蔽双绞线STP` 
base on `双绞线` 
make a layer `屏蔽层` which make of metal silk on `双绞线` 



### 3  `同轴电缆` 
have better `抗干扰特性` 

#### 4   compose
`内导体铜质芯线` , `绝缘层` , `网状编织的外导体屏蔽层` , `塑料外壳` 



### 3  `光缆` 
use `光导纤维` to transport `光脉冲` 
have `光脉冲` == 1 and haven't `光脉冲` == 0
because `频率` of `可见光` is very high, `传输带宽` is bigger than other transport media

#### 4   compose
`纤芯` , `包层` 

#### 4   `单模光纤`
When have only one `角度` incidence `light` , it named `单模光纤` 

#### 4   `多模光纤`
When have more than one different `角度` incidence `light` , it named `多模光纤` 
`多模光纤` suit short transport distance, because of `失真` 

#### 4   advantage
* capacity of communication is big
* `传输损耗小` , `中继距离长` 
* `抗雷和电磁干扰性好` 
* `无串音干扰` , `保密性好` 
* `体积小` , `重量轻`

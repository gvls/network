## 2 `非导引型传输媒体` / `无线传输` 
transport media is `free space` 
`无线传输` can use more `频段` 

### 3  `短波通信` / `高频通信` 
use reflect of `电离层` 
`sui落现象` and `多经现象` will decrease communication quality, so usual use low speed to transport

### 3  `无线电微波通信` 
transport by straight line
have width `频带` 
capacity of communication is very big
`signal` of disturb is low
communication is stabilization

#### 4   `地面微波接力通信` 
because earth is curly, so need use `接力` 
`接力` : `中继站` receive pre site and magnify it send to next site

#### 4   `卫星通信` 
transport distance is very long
cost is no relative with distance
have big `传播时延`

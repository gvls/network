## 2 `分组交换` 
`路由器` `转发` `分组` 

### 3  `路由器` 
only have : `physical layer` , `data link layer` , `network layer` 
because connect more than one `network` , have more than one `IP` 

### 3  `特定主机路由` 
basic on `路由器` 
save mapper from specific `goal IP` to `路由器` 

### 3  `路由表` 
be create by `分布式路由选择算法` 


### 3  `转发表` 
be create by `路由表` 
save mapper from `goal 网络号` to  `next address` (`接口` | `IP` of other `路由器` )
`接口` : `goal IP` is belong to own `newtork` and `直接交付` 
`IP` of other `路由器` : `goal IP` is belong to other `newtork` and `间接交付` 

* `默认路由` 
end of mapper to choose `路由器` 


### 3  process
in total process, `source IP` and `goal IP` is fixation
in every time `分组转发` , `source MAC` and `goal MAC` will be update

1. When `路由器` receive a `MAC帧` 
2. give it to `network layer` 
3. `network layer` get `IP data` 
4. get `网络号` from `IP data` 
5. search `转发表` : use `网络号` to get `next address` 
> if `goal 网络号` is belong to own `network` ( `直接交付` )
> if `goal 网络号` isn't belong to own `network` and belong to other `network` , send to other `路由器` (`间接交付` )
> if can't find mapper on `转发表` , give `IP dada` to `默认路由` 
> > if haven't `默认路由`, throw `分组出错` 
6. give `IP data` to `data link layer` 
7. `data link layer` use `ARP` to get `MAC` of `next address` and write this `MAC` to `MAC帧`

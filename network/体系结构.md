## 2 `系统网络体系结构` 
connect different network
`网络的体系结构` = all `layer` + `protocol` 

### 3  `TCP/IP`

### 3  data exchange
1. port of sender need confirm what port of receiver is prepare to receive
2. we need more than one computer to transform format of data which is different in two computer

* Isn't 100% for success
1. A send `message` to B
2. B send confirm `message` to A
3. A send confirm to confirm `message` to B
4. B send confirm to confirm to confirm `message` to A
...
`message` may be lose, and sender can't confirm what if send to goal

### 3  `层次划分` 
decompose big and complex problem to many small and simple problem
`super layer` use service which `sub layer` provide
`sub layer` provide service for `super layer` 
any `layer` needn't know detail of other `layer` 
`protocol` is level and `service` is vertical
no matter what `layer` , it's unit which transport data can named `分组` 

#### 4   advantage
all `layer` is independent
When one `layer` is change, we only need keep interface is constant
all `layer` can use best appropriate technology for own `layer` 
It is easy to implement complex system and maintain complex system
accelerate standard work

### 3  `协议protocol` 
A standard of data exchange

#### 4   `语法` 
format of data or structure of data and control message

#### 4   `语义` 
do what

#### 4   `同步` 
order of implement of event

### 3  `体系结构` of five `layer` `protocol` 
`对等层` is communication between the same `layer` 

#### 4   `应用层application layer` 

#### 4   `运输层transport layer` 

#### 4   `网络层network layer` 

#### 4   `数据链路层data link layer` 

#### 4   `物理层physical layer`

## 2 `核心部分`
Consist of different `network`(`异构网络` ) and `router`
Provide serve to `边缘部分`
Provide connectivity to `边缘部分`
`交换` : dynamic distribute resource of transmission link by some way

### 3  `router` 
#### 4   `电路交换` 
`建立链接` -> `通话` -> `释放链接` 
Two user use **dedicated communication resource of port to port** all the time
efficiency of transmission of line is low

#### 4   `报文交换` 
like `分组交换` , but data unit of transmission is `报文message`

#### 4   `分组交换` of `router` 
`router` accept `分组packet` and send `分组packet` by table

* `报文(message)` 
total data
include many `packet` 

* `分组/包(packet)` 
data unit of transmission
a part of `message` 
include `首部/包头(header)` and `data` 
When `router` accept a `packet` , it will save `packet` in memory (transmission efficiency)
When `packet` in transmission, it only occupy **resource of current link** rather than all link
